\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper I have described the process of setting up a HonePot
server with Modern Honey Network. I have also described how I 
processed the data, and how I preformed the statistical analysis.


I found that both the rate of attacks received and the rate 
of attacks launched did not have a strong linear correlation
to the time of day. 


An ANOVA test preformed on the rate of attacks received over 
the time of day showed that there is a difference in rates
significant at the 0.06 level.


If the same test is preformed on the
 time which the attacks
were launched, the difference is now significant at the 0.03
level.


There seems to be a peak of attacks launched at 
05:00 (see figure \ref{fig:over_day}), this may be 
because attackers assume that the security staff is 
not as responsive at such a late hour. But seeing as
how 90\% of attacks come from foreign time zones, this 
seems unlikely to be the reason.


Future work could be repeating this experiment in different
countries, collecting data over longer periods, figuring out
given a pattern, if it can be localized to a timezone.
